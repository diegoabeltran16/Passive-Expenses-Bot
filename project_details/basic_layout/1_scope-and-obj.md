# Project Details

## Passive Expenses Bot
Provide a simple tool for logging, viewing, and managing expenses, suitable for personal use and showcasing in a portfolio.

## Scope
The Passive Expenses Discord Bot is designed to help users manage and organize their passive expenses through a simple and intuitive interface within Discord. This project aims to provide a practical tool for logging, viewing, and managing expenses, tailored for personal use but robust enough to showcase in a portfolio. The bot leverages the Discord API and SQLite for seamless integration and reliable data management.

- The project now supports natural language interaction, allowing users to communicate with the bot in a more intuitive and conversational manner.

## Future Scope
- Further enhance the bot by adding additional financial tools, such as integration with financial planning APIs if needed.
- Regularly update the bot to reflect user feedback, new trends in expense management tools, and expanded language support.

## Objectives
- Create a Discord bot that allows users to log, list, and delete their passive expenses through simple commands.
- Implement SQLite for secure and reliable data storage, ensuring that all expense data is accurately logged and easily retrievable.
- Design an intuitive command structure that allows users to interact with the bot effortlessly, making the process of logging and managing expenses straightforward.
- Incorporate command aliases, monthly summaries, budgeting features, and an interactive setup process for enhanced user experience.
- Enhance user experience by implementing natural language processing (NLP) capabilities to interpret and respond to user inputs in a conversational style, with support for multiple languages (English and Spanish).
- Maintain support for structured commands while expanding the bot's ability to understand and process casual, everyday language in both English and Spanish.
- Ensure that the bot remains user-friendly, providing clear, helpful, and context-aware responses based on the input style and language chosen by the user.
