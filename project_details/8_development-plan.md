## Development Plan
We will structure the development into cycles of pre-co-requisite programming blocks, moving from the simplest to the most complex. Each cycle will be developed in a separate Git branch, ensuring each phase is independently tested before merging into the main branch. This approach will facilitate continuous integration, incremental improvements, and a robust, scalable, user-friendly bot.

### Cycle 1: Basic Setup and Initial Features
- Branch Name: cycle-1-basic-setup
- Objectives:
  - Set up the basic project structure.
  - Implement basic command handling.
  - Establish the SQLite database and CRUD operations.

- Tasks:
  - Project Setup:
    - Create the project directory structure.
    - Initialize Git repository.
    - Set up requirements.txt with necessary libraries (discord.py, sqlite3).

  - Basic Command Handling:
    - Create a Discord bot.
    - Implement basic command for testing connectivity (e.g., !ping).

  - Database Setup:
    - Design the database schema.
    - Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

  - Math and Algorithms:
    - CRUD Operations: SQL queries.
    - Basic Set Operations: Insert, Update, Delete records.

### Cycle 2: Logging and Listing Expenses
- Branch Name: cycle-2-expense-logging
- Objectives:
  - Implement expense logging feature.
  - Implement expense listing feature.

- Tasks:
  - Expense Logging:
    - Develop the command to log expenses (log expense).
    - Validate user input (amount, date, payment method).

  - Expense Listing:
    - Develop the command to list expenses (show expenses).
    - Display expenses in a user-friendly format.

  - Math and Algorithms:
    - Input Validation: Basic arithmetic checks.
    - Data Retrieval: SQL queries.

### Cycle 3: Deleting and Correcting Expenses
- Branch Name: cycle-3-expense-deletion
- Objectives:
  - Implement expense deletion feature.
  - Enhance input validation with NLU for correcting expense names.

- Tasks:
  - Expense Deletion:
    - Develop the command to delete expenses (remove expense [ID]).

  - Input Validation and Correction:
    - Integrate NLU for correcting user inputs.
    - Suggest corrections for misspelled expense names.

  - Math and Algorithms:
    - Levenshtein Distance: String matching.
    - CRUD Operations: SQL Delete queries.

### Cycle 4: Generating Reports
- Branch Name: cycle-4-report-generation
- Objectives:
  - Implement report generation feature using Generative AI.

- Tasks:
  - Report Generation:
    - Develop the command to generate reports (generate report).
    - Integrate with a Generative AI model to produce summaries.

  - Math and Algorithms:
    - Transformer Models: Attention mechanisms.
    - Probability Distributions: Generating coherent text.

### Cycle 5: Enhancing User Interaction
