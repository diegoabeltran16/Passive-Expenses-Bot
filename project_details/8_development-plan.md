# Project Details

## Development Plan
We will structure the development into cycles of pre-co-requisite programming blocks, moving from the simplest to the most complex. Each cycle will be developed in a separate Git branch, ensuring each phase is independently tested before merging into the main branch. This approach will facilitate continuous integration, incremental improvements, and a robust, scalable, user-friendly bot.

### Cycle 1: Basic Setup and Initial Features
- Branch Name: cycle-1-basic-setup
- Objectives:
  - Set up the basic project structure.
  - Implement basic command handling.
  - Establish the SQLite database and CRUD operations.
  - Integrate basic multilingual support.

- Tasks:
  - Project Setup:
    - Create the project directory structure.
    - Initialize Git repository.
    - Set up requirements.txt with necessary libraries (discord.py, sqlite3).
  - Basic Command Handling:
    - Create a Discord bot.
    - Implement basic command for testing connectivity (e.g., !ping).
  - Database Setup:
    - Design the database schema for storing expenses and user preferences.
    - Implement CRUD operations.
  - Multilingual Setup:
    - Integrate initial support for English and Spanish in basic commands.

### Cycle 2: Enhanced Command Handling and User Interaction
- Branch Name: cycle-2-enhanced-commands
- Objectives:
  - Expand command handling to include alias commands and natural language processing (NLP).
  - Develop the onboarding module for new users.
  - Implement user interaction flow with multilingual support.

- Tasks:
  - Command Handler Expansion:
    - Implement alias resolution for commands.
    - Integrate NLP module for processing natural language inputs in both English and Spanish.
  - Onboarding Module:
    - Develop an interactive onboarding process that guides new users through setup.
    - Ensure the onboarding process supports multiple languages.
  - User Interaction Flow:
    - Design and implement an intuitive interaction flow for logging expenses, setting budgets, and checking summaries.

### Cycle 3: Reporting and Data Management
- Branch Name: cycle-3-reporting-data
- Objectives:
  - Implement the reporting module for generating expense summaries.
  - Develop data management features, including backup and export.
  - Expand testing to include multilingual support and interactive features.

- Tasks:
  - Reporting Module:
    - Develop functionality to generate monthly summaries by category.
    - Ensure reports are generated in the user's preferred language.
  - Data Management:
    - Implement data backup routines.
    - Develop the feature to export data to CSV.
  - Testing Expansion:
    - Expand the testing suite to cover new features, ensuring reliability in both English and Spanish.

### Cycle 4: Advanced Features and Final Integration
- Branch Name: cycle-4-advanced-integration
- Objectives:
  - Implement advanced features, including budget management and automated data cleaning.
  - Finalize the integration of all components and prepare for deployment.
  - Conduct comprehensive testing across all features.

- Tasks:
  - Budget Manager:
    - Develop the budget tracking system, including alerts for nearing or exceeding budgets.
    - Ensure budget notifications are available in both English and Spanish.
  - Data Validation:
    - Implement automated data cleaning and validation checks.
    - Provide user prompts for reviewing and correcting flagged entries.
  - Final Integration:
    - Integrate all components and ensure they work seamlessly together.
    - Conduct end-to-end testing to validate the bot's functionality.
    - Prepare the bot for deployment, ensuring all documentation is updated and available in both languages.
