## Algorithms and Mathematics for the Passive Expenses Discord Bot

### Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
- Algorithms:
  - Tokenization: Breaking down text into words or tokens, supporting both English and Spanish.
  - Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS): Assigning parts of speech to each token, adaptable to multiple languages.
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying named entities in text, with support for multilingual entities.
  - Conversation Management: Algorithms that maintain context and flow of conversation, ensuring consistent and logical interactions across different languages.
- Mathematics:
  - Statistical Language Models: Calculating probabilities for token sequences, applicable to both English and Spanish inputs.
  - Embeddings: Representing words as vectors in a multi-dimensional space to capture their meanings and relationships, supporting cross-lingual embeddings.

### String Matching for Expense Names
- Algorithms:
  - Levenshtein Distance: Calculating the minimum number of single-character edits needed to change one word into another, applicable to various languages.
  - Fuzzy String Matching: Finding close matches between input strings and predefined categories, ensuring accuracy in both English and Spanish.
- Mathematics:
  - Edit Distance Calculation: Computing the number of edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) between strings, used to suggest corrections.
  - Cosine Similarity: Measuring similarity between two non-zero vectors, often used in conjunction with fuzzy matching to ensure accurate expense categorization.

### Generative AI for Report Generation
- Algorithms:
  - Transformer Models (e.g., GPT): Used to generate natural language reports from structured expense data, adaptable to generating reports in multiple languages.
  - Sequence-to-Sequence Models: Transforming a sequence of data into a sequence of text, applicable to summarizing expenses and generating insights.
- Mathematics:
  - Probability Distributions: Used within generative models to predict and generate the next word or sentence in a report, considering language-specific nuances.
  - Attention Mechanisms: Enabling the model to focus on relevant parts of the input data while generating reports, ensuring coherence and relevance.

### Data Validation and Cleaning
- Algorithms:
  - Anomaly Detection: Identifying outliers or unusual patterns in expense data, prompting users to confirm or correct entries.
  - Duplicate Detection: Automatically identifying and flagging potential duplicate entries for user review.
- Mathematics:
  - Statistical Analysis: Applying statistical methods to validate the consistency and integrity of the expense data, ensuring reliable records.
  - Clustering: Grouping similar data points together to identify patterns or anomalies, particularly useful in detecting irregularities in expenses.

### Budget Tracking and Notification
- Algorithms:
  - Threshold Monitoring: Continuously monitoring expense totals against set budget thresholds and triggering notifications when limits are approached or exceeded.
  - Predictive Analysis: Estimating future expenses based on historical data trends, helping users anticipate and manage their budgets.
- Mathematics:
  - Linear Regression: Modeling the relationship between expense categories and time to predict future spending trends.
  - Time Series Analysis: Analyzing time-based data to forecast future expenses and identify seasonal patterns or anomalies.
